            The global economy is about to undergo major paradigm shifts as a result of the development of AI. As AI technologies advance, it is anticipated that they will increase productivity and efficiency across a range of industries, creating new business models and financial frameworks.  But these changes will also bring with them new difficulties, such asÂ managing job displacement, maintaining fair distribution of economic gains, and navigating regulatory environments.

    <dd>AI tokens, which were first intended to handle AI jobs, are developing into a global digital currency as AI foundation models become essential to many industries. Similar to the conventional uses of gold and fiat currencies, this new kind of money can be employed in a variety of transactions. AI tokens are becoming more and more reliable as a solid substitute for the unpredictability of traditional financial systems, thanks to the support of a strong AI infrastructure. AI tokens are positioned to become a borderless currency necessary for international transactions as we move toward a digitalized, AI-driven world, marking the arrival of a new AI-fueled economy.

    <dd>The GDP per capita, a conventional indicator of economic efficiency, is being reexamined in light of the changing economic environment. Based on their energy-to-computational efficiency, AI foundation models are now assessed for their effects on economic growth. This emphasizes the idea that the more an AI model can do with less energy, the more it contributes to economic wellbeing. The ability of AI systems to convert energy into smart outputs, measured in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) per joule, becomes the new standard for economic efficiency.<br/>

    <dd>The AI landscape is inherently monopolistic, mirroring the historical domination of IT sectors, where cutting-edge firms such as Microsoft and Google wielded substantial market influence. This starts a vicious loop where these businesses increase their market monopoly by being the main, and frequently the only, suppliers of cutting-edge AI technologies. In the age of artificial intelligence, we face issues including maintaining fair market competition, safeguarding data privacy, and allocating the advantages of AI fairly.<br/>

    <dd>When it comes to governing the AI-driven economic structure, central banks may not have as much power as they do when it comes to certain corporations using AI foundation models. This is similar to how monetary policies are administered. These tech behemoths may end becoming guardians of the global economy, controlling information flow, computing duties, and the distribution of AI resources. Their supervision of AI tokens is comparable to that of central banks in terms of financial oversight. <br/>
