            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essentially a machine version of the human brain, replicating human intelligence and problem-solving abilities. However, the extent of this replication remains the concern, and till it does, its not the end for us nor is it the end of this technology's potential.

            Even among people who don't believe in the hype cycles surrounding AI, ChatGPT's release is regarded as a huge turning point. Previous advances in generative AI were mostly concentrated on computer vision, but recently, natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant gains. Modern generative artificial intelligence (AI) can learn and synthesize a wide variety of data kinds, including photos, videos, programming code, chemical structures, and human language.

            As expected its here to enhance the human experience. For example, generative AI tools, digital assistants and AI chat-bots are among the new advancements in technology that AI has brought about. Nevertheless, AI is advancing rapidly, and is beginning to portray itself as not all good, as its now leading way to conversations about AI ethics and responsibilities. Therefore UNESCO has established ten core principles regarding AI:
